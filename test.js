    history: 'Since ancient times, Phuc Loc workers have created carpentry products with sophisticated carvings to serve the construction of churches, temples, communal houses, pagodas,... Meeting the great demands of people during the 90s, Phuc Loc villagers started producing civil goods such as doors, tables, chairs, cabinets, traps, bars, stair handrails, interior decoration goods... and gradually introduced fine handicrafts (inlaid goods) into production.\r\n',
    product: 'In order to develop the craft village and bring economic efficiency, the village has transformed the highly specialized carpentry tools. The carpentry stages such as planning, polishing, turning, spraying paint... are replaced by machines to improve product quality and free up labor. At the same time, the newly replaced machines also reduce environmental pollution, especially noise pollution, and limit the risks caused by occupational accidents. However, with wooden products with small and delicate textures, no machine can replace the talented and skillful hands of Phuc Loc carpentry artisans.\r\n',
